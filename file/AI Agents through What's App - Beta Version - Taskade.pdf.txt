Plan for Beta version of Nour AI / Thoth AI on social media
Phase 1: Preparation & Planning
Given the specifics of the feature list and the focus on low-code, end-to-end solutions, the initial
phase should place a strong emphasis on selecting a platform that enables rapid iteration without
extensive coding. This selection will be critical to keeping the project within a reasonable budget
and accommodating the specified functionalities, such as Arabic Egyptian language support.
Phase 2: Setup & Integration
With the desire for quick and budget-friendly development, we could consider platforms like Twilio
in conjunction with Zapier, which offers extensive WhatsApp Business API integration capabilities.
The integration should be mapped out with a detailed workflow that defines how user interactions
trigger responses and how data is archived for progressive learning.
Phase 3: AI Enhancement & Validation
Personalization will be essential, even at the beta stage. For Nour AI to provide meaningful
interactions, the ability to remember user emails, names, and context is crucial. This requires
setting up a database or CRM system that works seamlessly with the chosen automation platform
to store and retrieve user information. Quality assurance could be handled by setting up automatic
logging of interactions for review by the development team, or by using AI testing platforms that
simulate user interactions.
Phase 4: Beta Testing
Leveraging the existing WhatsApp community for closed beta testing is an excellent approach. To
collect feedback, integrating a bot into the WhatsApp channel that periodically requests feedback
might be efficient. Alternatively, developing a simple web form linked at the end of interactions can
allow users to provide immediate feedback without leaving the WhatsApp environment.
Phase 5: Launch & Observation
The launch strategy that utilizes existing WhatsApp community groups complemented by other
social media accounts is a cohesive approach. Automating the process of user notifications and
updates about the beta within these platforms will be key. For performance monitoring, analytics
available through the WhatsApp Business API and any chosen automation platform can be used.
Additionally, custom dashboards could be developed to visualize KPIs and user interactions.
Documentation & Communication
Given the iterative nature of beta testing, documentation and communication will be continuous
and evolving. Ensuring that all team members have access to the latest updates, feedback, and
development changes is paramount for a smooth progression from one phase to another.
To align with these refined phases, we will need:
A selection of the automation and CRM platform.
